# Heroku Buildpack for GitHub Authentication

This is a Heroku buildpack that enables authenticated GitHub operations
within a Heroku dyno.

It detects a `PROGRAM_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable and creates a `.netrc`
file with a GitHub entry.

It is the soul sister of the [npm Buildpack](https://github.com/zeke/npm-buildpack).

See the blog post: [npm and GitHub automation with Heroku](http://zeke.sikelianos.com/npm-and-github-automation-with-heroku)

## Setup

First, create a new GitHub access token at
[github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

Then save this token in your Heroku app's config:

```sh
heroku config:set PROGRAM_BOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

Then configure your app to use this buildpack:

```sh
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/zeke/github-buildpack
```

The next time you push your app to Heroku, this buildpack will create a
`.netrc` file containing your GitHub token in the base directory of the app:

```sh
heroku run bash
cat .netrc
machine github.com login YOUR_TOKEN_HERE password x-oauth-basic
```

Now you can perform authenticated git operations on the dyno. Note that if
you want to `git commit`, you'll need to specify the git user and email:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/you/some-private-repo
cd some-private-repo
git config user.email "zeke@sikelianos.com"
git config user.name "Zeke Sikelianos"
touch some/file
git commit -am "git commit from a dyno!"
git push origin master
```

## Notes

This buildpack was inspired by [@timshadel/heroku-buildpack-github-netrc](https://github.com/timshadel/heroku-buildpack-github-netrc),
but the two differ in one significant way: the @timshadel buildpack
allows authenticated requests to be made only at **build time** (i.e. when your app is
being deployed), whereas this buildpack allows authenticated requests at
 build time and/or **run time** (when your app is actually running).
